= LaTeX template for UER thesis

== Preamble

This repo aims to serve as template for a thesis hold at the Universit√† Europea di Roma.

The content of the repo is public domain (CC0 1.0 Universal), so you can use it as you like.

For the scout rule however, I would appreciate it if you could contribute any improvements back.
This way, the next person to use this template will be able to build upon your enhancements, making further improvements even easier without having to repeat the same steps.

== Generate thesis

=== On Linux and with IntelliJ IDEA
- Install IntelliJ with TeXiFy plugin
- Install the following packages (commands are for ArchLinux):

[source, bash]
----
pacman -Ss texlive-basic texlive-bibtexextra texlive-bin texlive-binextra texlive-doc texlive-fontsextra texlive-fontsrecommended texlive-latex texlive-latexextra texlive-latexrecommended texlive-pictures texlive-plaingeneric texlive-xetex biber
----
- Open the main.tex and click on "Setup SDK" or setup the environment manually by pressing F4 on the project

=== Finally
- Create and run the first configuration with `Ctrl+Shift+F10`
- Now you can adjust the generated "main" Tex configuration to open the generated PDF, e.g. via `xdg-open {pdf}`
- Finally by running it (also via `Shift+F10`) the final main.pdf will be opened

NOTE: Golden rule for LaTeX newcomers: +
*just re-run*, if nothing then delete `out` folder and re-run. +
Only if all the attempts fail, then try to understand the errors and the warnings in the logs.
